        	<h2>Web Design</h2>
            <p>Below are listed some of the personal webpages I have designed over the years. Most of the sites are experimental and for my personal learning. Therefore, please recognize that some of these sites are incomplete.</p>
            <section class="main-list">
            	<section>
	            	<h3>Card Rogue</h3>
					<h4><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cardrogue.com/">View Website</a></h4>
					<p>Card Rogue is a Kickstarter boardgame I designed, developed, and created media for.  Part of the media was a fully supportive website including an interactive rulebook.  The website and rulebook had to work well on a mobile device as players are expected to use a tablet or phone to read the rules.  The rulebook also needed to print correctly if the user chose to print the webpage.</p>

            	<!-- <section>
	            	<h3>Best Chinking and Caulking</h3>
					<h4><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://bestchinkingandcaulking.com/">View Website</a></h4>
					<p>A contracted project to design a site for a log home chinking business. This site was intended to be visually appealing while also providing an extensive amount of information.</p>
				</section> -->
            	<section>
	            	<h3>Color of Artists</h3>
					<h4><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="../../other/color-of-artists/index.html">View Website</a></h4>
					<p>Color of Artists was a part of a large art project that I presented in 2013 at the University of Utah. The design was intended to be professional, artistic, and simple to understand.</p>
				</section>
            	<section>
	            	<h3>Our Solar System</h3>
					<h4><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="../../other/solar-system/index.html">View Website</a></h4>
					<p>While attending the University of Utah, I was asked to develop a website that had visual narrative, and encouraged exploration. I had one day to complete the project. I designed a website that told the story of our solar system. </p>
				</section>
				<!-- <section>
	            	<h3>Service Auction</h3>
					<h4><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="../../other/service-auction/index.html">View Website</a></h4>
					<p>I was asked by a local community to be the web designer for an online service auction. Though the project was never completed, the pages I designed were approved. I have uploaded the home page, but I have left off the other pages. The styling (CSS) was completely done by me, and the HTML was done by a separate developer. </p>

	            	<h3>The HUB</h3>
					<h4><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="../../other/the-hub/index.html">View Website</a></h4>
					<p>I originally designed The HUB to be template portfolio website for artists or designers. Since I have already created such a site for myself, I used it as a way to feature some of my favorite web sites. I tried to use simple, yet interesting, effects and aesthetics. It is a responsive website, and appears nicely on devices and on a monitor. This website is the best example of my current web-based coding style.</p>
