                <p>Crossfire is a territory control game that only requires two decks of standard poker cards and a table. The game involves two players starting at either end of the table making his way towards (and through) his opponent. There is a high level of strategy and tactics to obtain victory. A game session may take anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 minutes, depending on the aggressiveness of the players.  It's like Starcraft, but without so many aliens.</p>

                <p>Fortress is a game in rounds for 2 to 5 players. The concept is to protect royal cards in your hand while trying to capture your opponentâ€™s royals. The game can be played without a table, and only requires a single standard poker deck of cards (removing the Jokers). A game typically lasts 10 to 45 minutes, depending on the scoring used. Remember building forts as a kid?  It's not quite that level of awesome, but it does require significantly less pillows.</p>

                <p>Alchemy is a math and pattern recognition game that can be played alone or with a friend. Alone the game is quite casual and a good time killer. With a friend, the game is fast paced and chaotic. The single player game lasts about 10 to 15 minutes, while a two player game lasts about 20 minutes. The game only requires a single deck of cards.  If you're not good at simple addition, just play with someone who is much worse at arithmetic: like your pet baboon.</p>

                <p>Dice War is a small board game about moving dice into your opponent's zone and removing your opponent's dice before they get to your zone.  The game is a bit of strategy and a bit of dice rolling luck.  A game lasts about 30 minutes between two players.  The game requires 10 6-sided dice, 5 of each color.  It also uses a 20-sided dice for score keeping, but  it isn't required.  I bet you never thought you'd use those dice for anything besides D&#38;D.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Table Dungeon is essentially a D&#38;D derived card game with the all familiar classes, items, creatures, leveling, and brutal ends.  Players must work together to defeat the endless crawl of baddies; however, there is only one victor in the end, and so players must choose carefully when to be greedy and when to take one for the team.</p>
                <p>The game can be played with 2-4 players, and requires a die and standard deck of cards per player.  (e.g. if 4 players, it requires 4 dice and 4 decks).  It is recommended to have decks with different backs to keep things organized, as some deck mingling is done.  Setup takes about 5 minutes, and playtime varies on how long the players can survive.</p>
                <p>Feel free to roleplay your character during the game, but you are required to have an amazing accent.</p>
