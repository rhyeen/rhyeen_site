                    <p>Before an artist is posted on this project there are several steps required.<br><br>
I first try to find high-resolution images of an artist's work.  I find, on average, 100 of the artist's most famous paintings for the analysis.  Once I find my source imagery the images are run through a Java program that calculates the different types of averages.  These averages are displayed in the bottom 4 boxes. While the program is running, I combine all the images in Photoshop and change the transparency of each image so that they equally show through.  This image is for visual aesthetics only and does not influence the average color algorithm.<br><br>
My goal is to explore the different color palettes individual artists use and collective artists use in different eras.  If you feel that I am missing an important artist or era please visit the <a href="/art/color-of-artists/contact/index.html">contact page</a> and send me a message.</p>
