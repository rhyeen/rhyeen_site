                <p>The HUB is a convenient way to stack —like cards in a deck— my online content.  As an artist/designer I have hundreds of pages, artists, and blogs that I have bookmarked for creative references.  When I have a creativity block and need inspiration, I often start opening all these many bookmarks.  Since most of my bookmarks are rarely opened, I often forget why I bookmarked it in the first place.  The HUB is my solution to the hundreds of bookmarked pages.  Now I can create a card for every item I would have normally bookmarked.  Unlike bookmarks, I can also stack up images, quotes, blog posts, videos, or other content.<br></p>
