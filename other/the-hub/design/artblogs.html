            <section>
            	<p>Are you an art freak?  Good.  I've got some blogs for you.  This has all the blogs that I follow as a new media artist.</p>
                <a href="http://www.cavetocanvas.com/" target="_blank"><h2>Cave to Canvas</h2></a>
                <p>Cave to Canvas is THE go-to blog for art lovers.  Every week dozens of new artwork done by artists from all eras and posted to the blog.  There is really nothing else like it on the web.</p>
                
				<a href="http://hyperallergic.com/" target="_blank"><h2>Hyperallergic</h2></a>
				<p>If you want to keep updated on the events of the current art world, hyperallergic will be the site for you.  I will warn you that it gets very wordy and less arty in the articles.  But hey, art is more than the canvas its drawn on.</p>
                
                <a href="http://rhizome.org/" target="_blank"><h2>Rhizome</h2></a>
				<p>Much like Hyperallergic, it is about current art, which means new media art.  Though Rhizome does a pretty good job of sitting back and letting the viewer soak it in.</p>
                
                <a href="http://rhizomedotorg.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><h2>Rhizome.org</h2></a>
				<p>Ask me why there exists a Rhizome and a Rhizome.org (which doesn't even have a .org domain...) and I couldn't tell you.  But Rhizome.org really forgets about the comments about new media art and just shows new media art.</p>
                
                <a href="http://thestrangeattractor.net/" target="_blank"><h2>The Strange Attractor</h2></a>
				<p>The Strange Attractor is a happy medium between showing art and talking about it.  It's very well done, the only downside is that it is slow to put out new articles.</p>
