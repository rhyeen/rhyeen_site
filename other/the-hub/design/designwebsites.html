            	<p>Don't get it confused with the Web Design Blogs card.  This is specifically websites that are devoted to design as art.  It's more than just blogs though, because the best thing about design is how fast it can be spat out by hundreds of contributors.</p>
                <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/" target="_blank"><h2>Co.Design</h2></a>
				<p>Fastcompany's Co.Design blog is the best of the best for design related events/pieces.  The articles are fantastically well written and the content is always stimulating and up-to-date.  Co.Design is the one blog I check every weekday.</p>
                
                <a href="http://dribbble.com/" target="_blank"><h2>Dribbble</h2></a>
                <p>Yeah that's three b's.  Dribbble is an online portfolio for designers.  What makes it so good is that you have to be invited to dribbble to post to dribbble.  So only the best of the best actually contribute.</p>
                
				<a href="http://www.behance.net/" target="_blank"><h2>Behance</h2></a>
				<p>Behance is a lot like Dribbble except that anyone can join and post to Behance, and it really acts more like a portfolio than Dribbble does.  Made by Adobe, Behance is a great place to post your own work or to discover the work of many excellent artists.</p>
                
                <a href="http://thetypefight.com/" target="_blank"><h2>The Type Fight</h2></a>
				<p>Are you oddly obsessed with typography?  You're not alone.  This website contests two typographers in coming up with the perfect letter-of-the-week.  You can even vote as to who has designed the better letter Y.  Yeah.  I know.  It's cool.</p>
