                    <p>A website focused on promoting beautiful hotels.  But the real beauty is in the website itself.  It has a unique and powerful image layout, and uses negative space as if it was just as important as the images themselves.</p>

                    <p>Combadi does a good job of answering a typical user interface nightmare: how to intuitively catergorize content on a webpage.  The webpage highlights three different types of vacations, and uses color to quickly, and calmly, tell users which vacation falls into which category.  Brilliantly simple.</p>

                    <p>Skybox has designed their website to look like a printed magazine article.  It's brilliantly deceptive since it first appears as if it is just a .pdf, then as you mouse over the pats of the site, the images, text, and other elements, start magically forming into a fully immersize website.</p>
