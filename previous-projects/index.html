					<h3>Shardnova - An experimental SMS messaging MMORPG</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2018</span>|<span class="item-language">Implemented in Python3 an Docker</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rhyeen/shardnova_engine">View Repo</a></h4>
					<p>A prototype platform of a game that is played merely via SMS messages relayed between a server and the player; much like an old school text adventure game.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Card Rogue - A Tabletop Roguelike</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2017</span>|<span class="item-language">Designed, Manufactored, and Shipped Boardgame</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rhyeen/card-rogue-a-tabletop-roguelike">View Kickstarter Campaign</a></h4>
					<p>I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for a boardgame that sold over 1500 copies.</p>
				</section>

					<h3>Card & Board Games for a Buck.</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2016</span>|<span class="item-language">PDF Rules for Boardgame</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rhyeen/card-and-board-games-for-a-buck">View Kickstarter Campaign</a></h4>
					<p>I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for PDF rules to three games designed for play with the standard 52-card deck.</p>
				</section>
            	<section>
	            	<h3>P2P Offloading on Mobile Network</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2016</span>|<span class="item-language">Written in Python</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N16299">View Paper</a></h4>
					<p>I worked with the University of Utah's Flux Research group to improve latency of P2P services over the mobile network.  We worked on an emulated 4G/LTE network with a physical eNodeB (celltower).  Traffic flow was regulated using OpenFlow.  Testing on separate smart phones, we were able to significantly improve the latency between them.  A draft paper that was prepared for a mobile research conference can be found in the link above.</p>

	            	<h3>Health Related Habits - Visualized Using D3.js</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2015</span>|<span class="item-language">Implemented in D3.js and JavaScript</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="../other/datavisfinal/index.html">View Website</a></h4>
					<p>Created a D3.js interactive visualization using data sets from the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) annual questionnaire.  The visualization required intelligent filtering techniques to effectively explore the correlation among data sets.  A process book of design iterations is included in the site, as we had to carefully consider the user interface to be intuitive and enjoyable to use.</p>
					<p>Please, be patient as the website loads: the initial loading of the data can take over a minute.</p>
					<p class="retro-wrapper"><span>Retrospect:</span>The complexity of the project and the data normalization needed made the code quite cluttered.  I should have focused more on the organization, especially given the tight deadline.</p>

            	<!-- <section>
	            	<h3>Web Form Generator</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2015</span>|<span class="item-language">Implemented in PHP, jQuery, and MySQL</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rhyeen/WebFormGenerator">View on GitHub</a></h4>
					<p>My intention was to generate forms and tables of form inputs with only needing to write intializing code. This required a tight coupling to the database structure, but I was able to rapidly produce some fairly sophisticated multi-stage forms with front-end and back-end validation. Due to an unexpected job opportunity, I had to cease working on this project before completion.</p>
					<p class="retro-wrapper"><span>Retrospect:</span>I should have written the generator in the MEAN stack, as it is more appropriate for the data structure requirement and multi-stage forms.  Currently, I have converted the front-end to AngularJS and the back-end to Node.js.</p>

	            	<h3>Group Play Checkers</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2015</span>|<span class="item-language">Implemented in PHP, jQuery, and MySQL</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rhyeen/ChessGroupPlay">View on GitHub</a></h4>
					<p>This was a team project to create a web app checkers game that could be played against a friend, AI opponent, or with a global team. The project made use of Pixi.js for graphical rendering, and a centralized server for global team play.</p>
					<p class="retro-wrapper"><span>Retrospect:</span>The global team portion of the project required snycing with the backend every minute.  This created significant timing challenges.  Instead, we could have made use of WebSocket to have two way communication between client and server.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
	            	<h3>Teacher Assistant Application Form</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2015</span>|<span class="item-language">Implemented in PHP, jQuery, and MySQL</span></h4>
					<p>An iterative project completed over the course of several weeks, the Application website allowed Teaching Assistant (TA) candidates to submit his or her credentials to apply for a TA position.  Applicants, Instructors, and Administrators viewed separate content based on their login priviledges.  Applications were stored in a MySQL database, and applicable courses were scrubbed from the University of Utah's course catelog.</p>
					<p class="retro-wrapper"><span>Retrospect:</span>The requirements for the application form continued to change as the project advanced. This proved to slow my progress towards the end, and I had to frequently backtrack.  I should have modulized more and followed agile development more closely.</p>

            	<section>
	            	<h3>Android App of a Virtual Boardgame</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2015</span>|<span class="item-language">Written in Java</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rhyeen/CardRogueAndroid">View on GitHub</a></h4>
					<p>As part of a Kickstarter boardgame campaign, I created a virtual boardgame as an Android app that followed the same ruleset and used similar assets.  The game followed the MVC pattern and made use of the Android views and layouts.</p>
				</section> -->
            	<section>
	            	<h3>Cosmonautics - A Multiplayer 2D Space Shooter</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2014</span>|<span class="item-language">Written in C#</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rhyeen/Cosmonautics">View on GitHub</a></h4>
					<p>I decided to develop this game for two main purposes: I wanted to learn how to deal with graphics outside of GUIs, and I wanted to determine how to test a network connection with an intense and consistent data transfer rate. Cosmonautics uses the OpenGL API for graphics processing. The graphical elements were drawn in Adobe Illustrator and were manipulated in-game under simulated physics. This included a custom collision detection algorithm and particle simulation. The networking involves a TCP connection to a server, which communicates between all clients. Currently, I was attempting to convert to a hybrid TCP/UDP connection for a more fluid gameplay before I moved onto other projects.</p>

            	<!-- <section>
	            	<h3>Concurrent Spreadsheet</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2014</span>|<span class="item-language">Written in C# and C++</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="../other/spreadsheet_design_document.pdf">Download Design Document</a></h4>
					<p>This was a group project completed in collaboration with two other programmers. The goal was to create a spreadsheet application that could allow for multiple users to edit a spreadsheet concurrently; much like the functionality of Google Drive's Spreadsheet. The spreadsheets are stored on a server, which also allows for the spreadsheets to be opened and edited by simultaneous users. As a class project, each group had to propose a solution in a design document, which the class would vote on to use.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
	            	<h3>Secure Text Transfer</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2014</span>|<span class="item-language">Written in Java</span></h4>
					<p>A client-server communication protocol that authenticates, encrypts, and determines the integrity of a message. A double encryption method is used for fast and secure data transfer. Private and public key pairings are generated using RSA, and symmetric keys are generated using 3DES. Message digests are created using SHA-1 for message integrity checks. Finally, a simulated Certificate Authority is used for authentication of client to server.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
	            	<h3>Ball Animation added to FFMPEG</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2014</span>|<span class="item-language">Written in C and C++</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="../other/bouncer_design_document.pdf">Download Design Document</a></h4>
					<p>This project was about creating a program that uses the ffmpeg libraries to composite a sequence of animated images into a movie format. Ffmpeg libraries were to include a new image-animation format. A stand-alone application was also created for adding a ball animation to a user chosen background image.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
	            	<h3>HTTP Web Proxy</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2014</span>|<span class="item-language">Written in Java</span></h4>
					<p>A standard web proxy that observed all incoming and outgoing HTTP requests and responses through the Firefox browser. The proxy could easily be converted to blocking certain traffic.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
	            	<h3>Boggle Game with Server</h3>
					<h4><span class="item-date">2013</span>|<span class="item-language">Written in C# and HTML</span><a class="item-link" target="_blank" href="../other/boggle/game.html">View Example Stat Page</a></h4>
					<p>A multiplayer Boggle game that stores game statistics on a SQL database. Two players are paired together and play a randomized Boggle game on a standard Boggle board. An HTML page can be accessed from the server-side IP address on a browser to look up game and player stats.</p>
